								<p>Experiencing Dark Aoud by Montale in its initial stages is akin to walking into a pitch-black room.

								<p>A minimalist exploration of two powerful accords — oud and sandalwood — Dark Aoud starts out with the smoky, camphoraceous, medicinal aspect of oud on display, accompanied by a dry and elegant sandalwood. A sweeter, softer, and rounder sandalwood comes forth from its initial asceticism, rounding out the oud note's inky darkness and revealing its soft, even powdery spiciness. Although Dark Aoud gets softer through its long dry down, it remains an intense and mysterious <a href="#">presence</a> on your skin.
